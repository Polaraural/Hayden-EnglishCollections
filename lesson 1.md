#### 语法：同位语从句 
1. When reports came into London Zoo **that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London.** 加粗部分为reports的同位语从句。
- 同位语从句和定语从句的区别
  - 同位语从句和中心词是等值的关系，定语从句强调的是修饰和被修饰的关系
  - 同位语从句中的that不作语法成分，但一般不省，定语从句的that做主语或宾语，作宾语时可以省。
  - 同位语中除去that，剩余的部分仍为完整的句子；定语从句中去除that，剩余部分不是完整的句子。  
  eg: The first case of bird flu that was reported in Thailand captured the attention of officials with WHO.  
  常用于连接定语从句的连接词有:news,report,sign,belief,fact,idea....   

#### 句势亮点  
1. Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America.  
美洲狮是一种体形形似猫的大动物，产于美洲。  
解析：按照汉语思维，产于...应该是 be produced in，但是produced多指机械生产，而are found in表现的是一种动物的飘忽不定的特点，而且这个句型可以作为描述句型记到笔记本上去。
eg: Giant pandas are large, bear-like animals which are found mainly in Sichuan province, China.  
大熊猫是一种体态形似熊的大动物，产于中国四川。

2. When reports came into London Zoo ...  
解析:这里运用的是拟人的修辞手法，report - come into - Zoo，自己可以体会一下。

3. ...experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate...  
动物园的专家觉得很有必要进行一番调查。
解析:这里的有必要没有用felt forced to 而是用felt obliged to...区别主要在于前者受外因所迫，后者多指义务感和责任感，有“在其位，谋其政”的含义  
eg: Each citizen feels obliged to bring up the young and take care of the old.

4. ...a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.  
美洲狮除非被逼的走投无路，否则是不会攻击人类的。  
解析:本句中的will not和unless构成双重否定，用意是为了突出美洲狮有别于其他猛兽，即“人不犯我，我不犯人”。  
eg: One will not offend his superior unless he is conered.  

5. ...puma fur was found clinging to bushes.  
灌木草丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮毛.
解析:本句的亮点在英译汉的过程中主，被动语态动灵活应用，英文的被动式常常作为汉语的主动式处理，反之亦然。  
eg:English is spoken in various parts of the world.

6. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma.  
专家们如今相信那只动物是美洲狮了.  
解析：没有用sure，believe这些单词，而是因为这些词汇的主观性质很强，而be convinced 则更加注重客观，更符合文章的逻辑.  
eg:   
I believe he can fulfill the mission 主观.  
I'm convinced he can fulfill the misson 我相信他能完成任务.
