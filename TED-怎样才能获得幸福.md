The good life is built with good relationships.

The lessons aren’t about wealth or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get from this 75-years study is this: Good relationships keep us happier and healthier. Period.
1.	The social connections are really good for us and loneliness kills.
2.	It’s not just the number of friends you have, and it’s not whether or not you’re in a committed relationship, but it’s the quality of your close relationships that matters.
3.	Good relationships don’t just protect our bodies, they protect our brains.





Good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that’s as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?
Relationships are messy and they’re complicated and the hard work of tending to family are friends, it’s not sexy or glamorous. It’s also life-long. It never ends.
I’d like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.
“More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: There isn’t time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving.”
